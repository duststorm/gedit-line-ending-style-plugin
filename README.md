## Introduction
This is a plugin for Gedit 3 that allows the line ending style of documents to be quickly ascertained and changed. It adds a small, dual-purpose combo box to the status bar which indicates the current document's line ending style and allows it to be changed.

## Local installation
Local installation of the plugin is for when you don't have root access or you only want to install it for yourself.

Save the latest [`lineendingstyle.plugin`](https://github.com/dtrebbien/gedit-line-ending-style-plugin/raw/master/src/lineendingstyle.plugin) and [`lineendingstyle.py`](https://github.com/dtrebbien/gedit-line-ending-style-plugin/raw/master/src/lineendingstyle.py) to `~/.local/share/gedit/plugins`

## Notes
 *  It is not currently possible to undo changing the line ending style.

 *  The plugin was originally inspired by [Jeffery To](https://github.com/jefferyto)'s Newline Madness plugin for Gedit 2.
